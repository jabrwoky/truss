# Project Title

This project contains my solution to the Truss exercise

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

You will need Java 8 and Groovy
I use sdkman to install and manage versions. If you don't have sdkman, see https://sdkman.io/install to install
sdk install java 8u111
sdk install groovy 2.5.5


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
